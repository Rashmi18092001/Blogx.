    desc : "The Startup Challenge is a worldwide call for innovative startups to interact and collaborate with Sandvik experts. The challenge is run by Sandvik together with its partners SynerLeap and Microsoft. The nine finalists in this year’s Challenge took to the stage in Stockholm on November 9 to present their solutions, after which the jury convened to pick the winning teams. Pasi Kangas, Head of Technology at Sandvik Additive Manufacturing and Jury Chairman explains the reason behind it: “The ongoing digitalization of mining and manufacturing requires advanced, connected systems. We are looking for the brightest minds and best ideas for software and equipment that let Sandvik and its customers work faster, more sustainably and more efficiently,” he said. “I am very happy about the great response and quality of the applications, and the enthusiasm and energy surrounding this call, both from the Sandvik teams and all startups that we have collaborated with.” Each of the three Sandvik business areas offered a unique challenge. The winning startups, from Finland, Luxemburg and the US, received Swedish crystal artwork and funding up to USD 30,000 to collaborate with Sandvik on the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can be productized and offered to Sandvik customers.",

Since then, he’s grown the business to 16 employees, has expanded to hundreds of styles and gives back to a variety of nonprofits. Digital tools like Google Ads have been critical to growing his business, helping him efficiently build his brand and connect with customers from across the world. As we celebrate Black-owned businesses this Black History Month, we had a few questions for Randy about how he got started and his advice for other aspiring business owners. How were you inspired by other Black-owned businesses before founding Talley & Twine? Seeing other successful Black-owned businesses inspired me by showing me what was possible. Black entrepreneurs are more than business owners; they're leaders in their communities. Seeing them opened my mind and allowed me to be creative and to dream. I'm still inspired daily by the creativity and ingenuity of entrepreneurs from my community.  What do you know now that you wish you had known on Talley & Twine’s first day? In the beginning stages of starting Talley & Twine, I had no idea of the true power of having a great team around you. The synthesis and growth you can experience with a team versus working solo are unmatched. Knowing what I know now, I would have sought out partners and employees much sooner.",

    desc : "Ver abajo versión en español. At the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which I have the honor to lead as president and CEO, helping Latino-owned businesses succeed is at the center of our mission. Our responsibility to the more than 4.7 million Latino-owned businesses and our growing network of 260 local chambers and business associations nationwide is to pursue and advocate for inclusive economic growth and development that build shared prosperity. We represent the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in the U.S., and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. The number of Latino business owners has grown by 34% over the last 10 years compared to just 1% for all other businesses, according to a recent study by the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative, and much of this growth has been driven by Latinas. These new businesses are invigorating, highlight our potential and are what motivates me everyday. In 2020, with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, our chambers became emergency rooms for small businesses. We quickly mobilized and awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants directly to Latino owners and our local chambers to provide assistance. These funds were a lifeline for Latino businesses to keep the lights on, make payroll, rent and meet other critical needs. We also provided technical assistance, established online resource hubs in English and in Spanish and graduated more than 200 Latino-owned small businesses through our accelerator program. Last year was also our most active year in Washington, D.C. We raised $850 billion to provide assistance for our Latino small business members. We advocated for access to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for both Latino-owned businesses and 501(c) (6) Chambers of Commerce.",

    desc : "More British businesses than ever before are maximising the opportunities created by the digital economy, whether that’s high-street bakeries using online ordering systems to help deliver treats to customers, or local fitness instructors using apps to enable them to offer both online and in-person classes. Technology has helped many entrepreneurs across a wide variety of sectors that might not have previously been considered ‘digital' to launch websites and develop apps which have helped them to grow their ventures, reach new customers and boost their productivity. Increasingly, businesses are viewing technology as an important part of their future plans. However, while the digital economy has created growth opportunities for businesses, it’s also captured the imagination of criminals on the hunt for vulnerabilities they can exploit. In today's increasingly connected world, businesses of all sizes have become targets for cyberattacks. Small business owners need to be able to protect their digital infrastructure, in the same way that they’re able to fortify their brick and mortar premises. The shortage of cybersecurity experts threatens to impact their ability to both prevent cyber attacks and quickly take action in the event of a data breach. Google’s Cybersecurity Career Certificat. Both the lack of digital skills and cybersecurity concerns are listed among the top digitalisation barriers for SMEs. Research from Kantar shows that 43% of UK SMEs have been unable to hire cybersecurity support due to the shortage of specialists or the difficulty attracting, retaining or contracting cybersecurity experts. An analysis of job posts in Britain between January 2022 to January 2023 shows a 59% increase in the number of advertised cybersecurity related roles, with almost 70,000 unique job postings advertised during that time. Left unaddressed, this skills shortage could prevent people from maximising the full potential of the UK’s digital economy.",

There’s just something about bananas when they get baked that makes them incredibly irresistible to me. That sweet and sticky caramelized banana flavor – I just can’t get enough! These lil banana muffins are perfect because they’re individually sized and portioned. I love popping one into my pocket before heading out on an evening walk because there’s nothing better than watching the sunset on a bench with your favorite person in the world and a banana muffin. This is the best banana muffin you’ll ever make. But first, what is a banana muffin? Maybe you think this is a silly question, but this is the kind of thing that goes on in my head. Just what the heck is a banana muffin? Is a banana muffin banana bread in a muffin shape? Is it banana cake in a muffin shape? Just what makes a muffin a muffin? Deep existential muffin thoughts aside, for the purpose of this post, a banana muffin is a little cake, made in the shape of a muffin with a muffin wrapper that is sweet, tender, moist, and full of banana flavor. These banana muffins have an even tight crumb with a nice bouncy springiness and just a touch of stickiness. It’s not too sweet and there are massive banana tones and subtle caramel notes.",

What is General Tso’s Chicken General Tso’s chicken is crispy, deep-fried chicken tossed in a sweet and tart sticky sauce that has just a bit of spice. Its origins are murky at best and no one is quite sure who created it, but everyone agrees that General Tso’s chicken is named after Zuo Zongtang, a military leader from the Qing dynasty who had most definitely not tasted the chicken that’s named after him. What we do know is that General Tso’s chicken is uniquely Chinese-American and incredibly delicious.How to make General Tso’s Chicken. This is one of the easiest Chinese dishes you’ll ever make: Marinate: In a large bowl, whisk together the ingredients for the chicken coating until light and frothy. Toss in the chicken pieces and let sit at room temperature. Batter: Place 1 cup of cornstarch in a bowl. Spoon out 2 tablespoons of the chicken coating and whisk into the cornstarch to form small clumps. These will add extra crispy bits to your chicken. Working in batches: throughly coat several pieces of chicken in the cornstarch, and shake off the excess. Fry: Fry these however you like! See the sections below on air fryer vs oven baked vs deep fry. Deep fry will always produce the best results, but more often than not, we grab the air fryer for its ease and healthiness. Sauce: Once all of your chicken is done and resting in the oven, make the sauce. Add the sauce ingredients and cook, stirring, until the sauce comes to a boil and starts to thicken. Remove from heat, then add the chicken. Enjoy: Toss throughly to coat and enjoy immediately.",

But a couple of weeks ago, Mike and I were chatting with a dude that moved here from England and the thing he said he missed the most was breakfast, specifically a Full English breakfast. He waxed poetic about the deliciousness for a good five minutes, but I wasn’t sold. Mike was nodding along, agreeing with him because he’s eaten many a full English in London, but me? Nope. I really wasn’t interested until Mike showed me a photo a couple days later. It was a giant plate and it looked AMAZING. I mean, it might have been because I was very hungry, but at the time, nothing looked better to my eyes. Thus started the Full English Obsession. Mike and I took a casual look around town to see what ingredients we could find and here’s what we came up with! What is a full English breakfast? Sometimes called a fry up, a full English is a hearty, hefty breakfast plate served in the UK and Ireland. Full English breakfasts are so popular that they’re pretty much offered throughout the day as all-day breakfast.

Neda’s flight home was on the 30th, and seeing as it was the 28th (and buses in Bolivia? Not so much on the reliable side) we had to book whatever was available. We bought tickets with a company that had only 4 seats left on the bus and assured us that it was a “semi-cama” (half bed) bus with heating. Did I say assured? I should have said blatantly lied. The bus sputtered up to the bus company´s office at our 8pm departure time and our jaws dropped. The bus was an out of service bus from Brazil (i.e. had no legs left on it and was sent to Bolivia instead) and was rusty, noisy and falling apart. Windows were taped together with clear, not-so-durable tape, the edges already peeling off in the cold. In the short interval between the arrival of the bus and our departure, a fight broke out in the back (over seats, of course) and in the resulting squabble another window was broken. The attending rushed over with tape, frantically trying to repair the window. We didn’t leave on time. All of the tourists at Uyuni’s bus station stood, jaws agape. Then they took their cameras out – this bus was too bad not to immortalize in picture form. Neda, Jess and I exchanged a look – we were in big trouble.",

He or she must have been sitting on my ass for who knows how long. My heart raced, my leg felt numb, and my tongue started to swell.

Though I’ve aggregated plenty of them during my roaming, each is a frozen-in-time moment that I can’t seem to explain properly – I end up trailing off into a cloud of memories to the confusion of everyone else in the conversation. Trying to describe them always sounds like one giant cliche. “I wanted to stay there forever!” or “It was so beautiful, it brought me to my knees!” Wadi Rum, with its rust and gold and rivulets of sand, with the water in the far distance and the cliffs lining the seemingly endless wide open space of the desert, is now one of those places. Nothing I write comes close to the majesty of seeing the valley stretch out before me. I’ve always been a fan of wide open spaces. I grew up in Montreal with long winters punctuated by snowstorms in even bursts. During those cold months, the sky felt like it was snuggling closer to the ground, with grey-white clouds looming just over the buildings as the flurries rolled in. Winter in Montreal isn’t all dreary; the snow is interspersed with blinding blue skies on days when the temperature plummets sharply, too cold for precipitation. But even clear and sunny, the city felt like it was encased in a bubble, inexorably shrinking until spring was upon us again.",

White’s The Making of the President, which pioneered the literary-journalistic style that brought novelistic technique and imagination to political reporting; Hunter S. Thompson’s classic of alienated campaign reporting, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 1972; Richard Ben Cramer’s What It Takes: The Way to the White House, which has been described as “an American Iliad in the guise of contemporary political reportage”; and excerpts from Robert Caro’s renowned The Power Broker and LBJ series. The course will conclude with study of two government reports, parts of which escaped the limitations of the genre: the introduction to the US Senate’s Hurricane Katrina report (written by Boris Fishman), and the opening chapters of the 9/11 Report.Each week, several students will be asked to submit a short writing assignment that engages with the politics of the day (or the past) in an original writing style inspired by the books we discuss. Class discussion will be evenly divided between a Socratic discussion of the reading assigned for that day and an informal workshop of the submitted exercises.

I am not sure which one would be heard more in the northern states, but it’s likely that the lord would take a backseat once the saffron poll caravan moves south of the Vindhyas and enters Tamil Nadu. So, what would be the poll planks in the Dravidian land and who would benefit – in terms of campaign noise, not necessarily votes – from which issue? Read on. Corruption: BJP would love to make this its prime topic of campaign in Tamil Nadu. The grapevine has it that K Annamalai, who has released a couple of ‘DMK files’ which met with reasonable success, has a few more ‘bombs’ up his sleeve. If that’s true, DMK has something to worry about. Corruption is such an evergreen campaign issue that voters lap it up. So, it doesn’t matter that the corruption cases against minister without portfolio Senthil Balaji and disqualified minister K Ponmudy are from another decade. That such people have been in the Stalin cabinet is ammunition enough for the opposition. But the AIADMK, which has a handful of leaders who face corruption charges, cannot be holier than thou during the campaign. While the main opposition party in the state may benefit collaterally from corruption being a campaign issue, the BJP will gain fire power. How much of this would convert to votes, however, remains a moot point. ",

This is why we started a gaming residency program challenging developers to build games that connect players with art like never before. Last year we launched some of these playful experiences and today we are very excited to share another. For this project we challenged the expert storytellers at inkle — the independent studio behind games such as Overboard!, Heaven’s Vault and A Highland Song — to take people on a unique journey of artistic discovery and exploration — and they came up with The Forever Labyrinth. “When we began, we were pretty overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the corpus,” recalls Jon Ingold, inkle's narrative director. “The Forever Labyrinth is a game played by making connections between artifacts, and it's a story about making connections between people and art. By digging deeper into the incredible archive available it gave us the scope to make the game bigger and broader, adding more art that connected in new and different ways. And in turn that meant we could add more stories and secrets to explore.”",
